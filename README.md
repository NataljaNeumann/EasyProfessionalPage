# Easy Professional Page
This project helps you to easily make professionally looking web pages, by providing a CSS that
you can include in your web pages that will style the elements in your pages. The CSS comes
with a calm color scheme. You need to define colors of your page yourself. Of course, you can
ask an AI for providin you a color scheme that is adapted to your needs.

Especially the CSS supports three different color schemes:
- For screens with light color preference
- For screens with dark color preference
- For print

You need to define all three color schemes, as well as the sizes of margins and elements,
then the CSS will get its power for styling the element on your page.

The sizes and colors are stored in variables, so you don't need to specify them on
each element.
